                           EXECUTE

FunctionalCalculator is written in Java 1.8 and the .jar file should be
directly executable or it should be able to be made executable depending
on your operating system. For example if you use Linux, you might need to
insert in your terminal:

cd ".../FunctionalCalculator"
sudo chmod 777 functionalcalculator.jar

It is necessary to have installed a Java Runtime Environment to use this
program.


                           GENERAL INFORMATION

FunctionalCalculator is a Mathematical program, which calculates with
functions and which is designed to be functional in the sense of
convenience and usability. It is designed to be as easy to run as a hand-
held calculator. The goal of the project is a neat tool covering the
Mathematics at university level and advanced high-school level.

FunctionalCalculator has 75 User-Functions and boolean / comparision
operators. The User-Functions can have arguments given by matrices,
infinitely differentiable functions, complex numbers or arbitrary
precision integers. Among the User-Functions you find for example:

* The integral of f(x) from a to b
* The derivative of f(x)
* The Ternary Conditional
* The gcd of two integers
* Solve a System of Linear Equations

FunctionalCalculator has a plotter for complex functions and a plotter
for real functions. FunctionalCalculator has a Grammar. Thus you can
store variables and compose and combine several operations and User-
functions. In particular you can define your own recursive (meta)
functions by using the Ternary Conditional.

Moreover FunctionalCalculator has a functional and procedural scripting
language using its grammar. You should get some example scripts with this
release of FunctionalCalculator.

FunctionalCalulator uses the mathematical libraries colt and apaches
common-math3. Moreover apaches common-lang3 is used.
